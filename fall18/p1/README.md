# Project 1

In this project, you'll learn about types, operators, and boolean
logic.  To start, download these two files:

* [main.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p1/main.py)
* [test.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p1/test.py)

You will change main.py and hand it in.  You should not change
test.py, and you should not hand it in; it's only purpose is to tell
you your grade in advance.

After you've downloaded both files to the same directory, open your
terminal, navigate to that directory, and run the following:

```
python test.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
RESULTS:
  Problem 1: PASS
  Problem 2: expected (4) but found (0)
  Problem 3: PASS
  Problem 4: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 5: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 6: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 7: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 8: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 9: fewer output lines than expected
  Problem 10: expected (7) but found (34)
  Problem 11: expected (!!!!!!!!!!) but found (!!!)
  Problem 12: expected (30) but found (3333333333)
  Problem 13: expected (27), got (9)
  Problem 14: expected about $15,424
  Problem 15: expected (False) but found (True)
  Problem 16: expected (True) but found (False)
  Problem 17: expected (True) but found (False)
  Problem 18: expected (True) but found (False)
  Problem 19: expected (True) but found (False)
  Problem 20: expected about 37.69
Score: 10%
```

This means if you turn in main.py now, you'll get 10% for your score.
Pretty good for having done nothing yet, no?

You would get 10% because there are 20 problems, each worth 5%, and we
have done problems 1 and 3 for you.  You can see this because the
output above says "PASS" by them.  Your goal is to get more points by
getting test.py to print "PASS" by more problems.

The rest of the instructions are in main.py, so open it up in your
editor (probably PyCharm), and start coding.  Have fun, and run
tests.py often to track your progress!
