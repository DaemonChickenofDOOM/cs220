# Final Project

For your final CS 301 project, you're going to analyze the whole
world!

Specifically, you're going to study various statistics for 238
countries, answering questions such as: what is the correlation
between a country's literacy rate and GDP?

# General Directions

The final project is due on December 12, but we're breaking it into
three stages.  We'll be releasing one stage each week.  You can set
your own work schedule (e.g., it would be a bad idea to try this, but
you could complete all three stages on December 11 if you like).  We
recommend trying to complete one stage each week so you don't leave
too much work until the end.

You'll be doing all your work in a notebook, and when you're done,
you'll turn in a `main.ipynb` file.

As usual, you can work with one partner.  Please include the usual
comments
([directions](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/fall18/projects.html))
in the first cell of your notebook.

# Data

For this project, you'll be using 238 data files describing countries
and 175 data files describing capitals.  The data was adapted from
[here](http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals) and
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world).

These two pages list the 238 country files and 175 capital files respectively:
