# Project 1

Much of challenge of programming involves setting up your computer
properly and learning how to use various tools.  This project (worth
1% of your course grade) is designed to walk you through how to
download project files, create a Python notebook, run tests, and turn
in your project.  We assume you're either using a lab machine, or
you've downloaded [Anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download) on
your personal computer.

In subsequent projects, you'll need to very carefully follow [course
policy](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/spring19/syllabus.html)
to avoid academic misconduct, but for this project, we just want to
walk everybody through the process.  So feel free to get any kind of
help from anybody (fellow students or otherwise) for P1.

## Step 1: Download Project Files

The first thing you're going to need to decide is where to keep your
project work this semester.  If you don't have a preference, we
recommend creating a folder named "cs301" under "Documents".  How to
find the Documents folder may vary from computer to computer.  On a
Windows machine, you might find it like this in File Explorer:

<img src="windows-documents.png" width="200">

On a Mac, you might find it in Finder here:

<img src="mac-documents.png" width="200">

Inside the new "cs301" folder you created under "Documents", we
recommend you create a sub-folder called "p1" and use it for all your
files related to this project.  This way, you can keep files for
different projects separate (you'll create a "p2" sub-folder for the
next project and so on).

## Step 2: Create a Python Notebook

## Step 3: Copy/Paste Code

## Step 4: Run the Tests

## Step 5: Hand in the Project
