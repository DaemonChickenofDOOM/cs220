# Project 4

## Description

The CS 301 midterm is coming up, so now is a good time to begin to study. A great resource for preparing is to look at the old midterm exam which is available [here](https://github.com/tylerharter/caraza-harter-com/tree/master/tyler/cs301/spring19/materials/old-exams). Since we've been learning about conditionals this week, for this project we'll build an automated study tool program to quiz you on the questions. You'll get practice with conditionals and while loops.

Start by downloading `test.py`. Double check that these files don't get renamed by your browser (by running `ls` in the terminal from your `p4` project directory). You'll do all your work in a new `main.ipynb` notebook that you'll create and hand in when you're done.  You'll test as usual by running `python test.py`.

The lab this week is designed to give you practice with conditionals and while loops, so be sure to do the lab from home (if you missed it) before starting the project.

## Questions and Functions

### Part 1: Ask a question, get an answer

Ask the user

```
What is the type of the following? 1.0 + 2.0
```

### Part 2: 


### Q3: How much did "streets" spend in 2017?

Hint: instead of repeatedly calling `project.get_id("streets")` (or
similar) for each function, you may wish to make these calls once at
the beginning of your notebook and save the results in variables,
something like this:


```python
def change_per_year(agency, start_year=2015, end_year=2018):
     pass # TODO: replace this line with your code
```
