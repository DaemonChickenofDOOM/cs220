# Lab 5

## Corrections

## Project 5 Project.py interface
To understand the
functions that are defined in *project.py*, you may open that file and
read the docstring (i.e., the line(s) below the function definition that
documents the purpose of the function). You may also find the purpose
of each function by doing the following on your python console:
```python
>>> import project
>>> project.getNumRecords.__doc__
'This function will return the number of records in the dataset'
>>>

```
How many functions are included in project.py?

Which functions are used by p5 ?

## Zero Index and String lengths
We talked about it in lecture, and we'll need it for the project, and it's a common source of bugs. So let's practice our skills with zero indexing and strings!

The textbook has an excellent suggestion to get used to strings:
  "Write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters backward, one per line."

  Do this once using a `while` loop, and once using a `for` loop

## More String practice!

The website CodingBat https://codingbat.com/python has great interactive coding exercises for beginners. Try to complete the 'String-1' and 'String-2' examples.
