# Project 9: Twitter

## Clarifications/Corrections

* none yet

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be analyzing a collection of actual tweets.
This data is messy!  You'll face the following challenges:

* data is spread across multiple files
* some files will be CSVs, others JSONs
* the files may be missing values or be too corrupt to parse
* some integer values may be represented as strings with a suffix of "M", "K", or similar

In stage 1, you'll write code to cleanup the data, representing
everything as Tweet objects (you'll create a new type for these).  In
stage 2, you'll analyze your clean data.

## Setup

**Step 1:** download `tweets.zip` and extract it to a directory on your
computer (using [Mac directions](http://osxdaily.com/2017/11/05/how-open-zip-file-mac/) or
[Windows directions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028088/windows-zip-and-unzip-files)).

**Step 2:** download `test.py` and extract it to the directory from step 1 (`test.py` be next to the `sample_data` directory, for example)

**Step 3:** create a `main.ipynb` in the same location.  Do all work for both stages there, and turn it in when complete.

## The Stages

* [Stage 1](stage1.md): parse a mix of CSV and JSON files to get Tweet objects
* Stage 2: not released yet
